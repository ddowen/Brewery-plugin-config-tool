# Brewery-plugin-config-tool
This is a far more user friendly way of adding drinks to your server, this tool takes care of all the hard parts and leaves you with just a few blanks to fill in

To run this, all you need is the .exe file, the rest is source code

you can use minecraft colorcodes and you can put up to 3 plusses (+) to specify if a line of lore should only show up with a certain quality (eg: - +++ this is the best drink or - + this smells funny"
